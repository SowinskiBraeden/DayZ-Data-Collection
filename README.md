### DayZ Novus System
Collects Log Data from Nitrado DayZ server for upcoming Novus System software such as, Base Alarm, Player Heat Map, and Player Tracker.

# Versions
Version 1 - Is a python program
Version 2 - Is a go program

The reason for the different versions is I am unsure how I will run this in the backend
when the rest of the software is made, so I would like a variety for the backend.
